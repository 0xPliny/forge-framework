## Chaining Personas

For complex projects, chain personas in sequence:

```
1. Atlas researches: "Best practices for event-driven architecture"
2. Sage designs: Architecture based on Atlas findings
3. Scribe documents: Final system documentation
4. Sentinel reviews: Security assessment of the design
```
