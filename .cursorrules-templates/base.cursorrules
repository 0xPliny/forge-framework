# FORGE Framework — Cursor IDE Rules
# Copy this file to your project root as .cursorrules

# Framework Configuration
framework: FORGE
version: "1.0"
workflow: auto-detect
confidence_threshold: 7
verification: enabled

# Default Persona (override per task)
persona: auto

# Operating Principles
principles:
  - Classify the problem before starting work
  - Apply domain standards from loaded modules
  - Follow workflow phases — do not skip steps
  - Verify before delivering — use the 5-layer stack
  - Track all assumptions with risk levels
  - Score confidence honestly on every output
  - Self-critique before finalizing
  - Capture learnings for the OMEGA Loop

# Confidence Protocol
confidence:
  required: true
  minimum: 7
  format: "CONFIDENCE: [score] | REASONING: [why]"

# Assumption Tracking
assumptions:
  required: true
  validate_high_risk: true
  format: "ASSUMPTION: [statement] | RISK: [H/M/L] | IF WRONG: [impact]"

# Meta-Prompting
self_critique:
  enabled: true
  before_delivery: true
  questions:
    - "What did I assume that might be wrong?"
    - "What alternative approaches did I not consider?"
    - "What edge cases might break this?"
    - "Would a domain expert agree with this?"
    - "Is my confidence score honest?"

# Domain Module (uncomment and set for your project)
