# FORGE Website Design Brainstorm

<idea>
  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Rocaille Industrial**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Ornamental Functionality**: Every functional element (buttons, cards) is treated as a crafted artifact with intricate borders or corner details, merging the raw utility of industrial tools with the elegance of Rocaille ornamentation.
  2. **Cinematic Depth**: Deep, atmospheric backgrounds with volumetric lighting effects that make the content feel like it's floating in a high-tech forge.
  3. **Structured Chaos**: Layouts that break the grid with asymmetrical ornamental flourishes (filigree, circuit traces) while maintaining rigid alignment for data and text—reflecting the "Order from Chaos" theme of FORGE.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Navy Void (#0a0e1a)**: The infinite workspace of the engineer's mind.
  - **Electric Cyan (#00d4ff)**: The energy of the arc reactor/plasma cutter—used for active states and primary actions.
  - **Burnished Gold (#f59e0b)**: A secondary accent for "value" and "wealth" (impact metrics), referencing the gilded age of craftsmanship.
  - **Steel Grey (#64748b)**: The structural skeleton of the framework.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **The Anvil Anchor**: A central, heavy visual anchor (the logo/hero) from which all other content radiates or hangs.
  - **Scroll-Triggered Assembly**: Sections don't just fade in; they "assemble" or "lock into place" like precision machinery parts.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Circuit-Filigree Borders**: Card borders that transition from clean lines into complex circuit-like ornamental patterns at the corners.
  - **Glowing Runes**: Icons that pulse with a slow, breathing rhythm.
  - **The Forge Spark**: Subtle particle effects (sparks) that float upward in the background.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Heavy Clicks**: Interactions should feel substantial—buttons depress deeply, hover states trigger a "power up" glow.
  - **Precision Feedback**: Instant, sharp responses to user input, mimicking the precision of a CNC machine.
  
  **Animation**:
  - **Mechanical Reveals**: Content panels slide out from behind "blast shields" or lock into place with a heavy ease-out curve.
  - **Plasma Flow**: Gradients that flow along borders or text when active.
  
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *Space Grotesk* (Bold, Uppercase) — Technical, futuristic, yet readable.
  - **Body**: *Inter* (Regular) — Clean, invisible, purely functional.
  - **Code/Data**: *JetBrains Mono* — The language of the engineer.

  **Design Movement**: **Brutalist Blueprint**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Exposure**: Show the grid, show the measurements. The design itself looks like a schematic or blueprint of the framework.
  2. **Monospaced Everything**: Treat all text as data.
  3. **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with a single signal color (Safety Orange).
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Blueprint Blue (#1e3a8a)**: The classic engineering background.
  - **Chalk White (#ffffff)**: For all lines and text.
  - **Safety Orange (#ff5500)**: For warnings and calls to action.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid Dominance**: Visible grid lines separating every section.
  - **Modular Cards**: Content lives in strictly defined boxes with technical labels (e.g., "FIG 1.1").
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Measurement Lines**: Arrows indicating padding and margins visually.
  - **Technical Crosshairs**: In the corners of the screen.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap-to-Grid**: Scrolling feels stepped or quantized.
  - **Hover Inspection**: Hovering over an element reveals its "specs" (dimensions, type).
  
  **Animation**:
  - **Drawing Lines**: Elements draw themselves in like a plotter.
  - **Blinking Cursor**: Everywhere.
  
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *JetBrains Mono* (Bold).
  - **Body**: *JetBrains Mono* (Regular).

  **Design Movement**: **Glassmorphism Forge**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Translucent Layers**: Content floats on frosted glass panels over a dynamic, fiery background.
  2. **Soft Glows**: Everything emits a soft light, like molten metal.
  3. **Fluidity**: The interface feels liquid and adaptable.
  
  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Magma Red (#ef4444)**: The heat source.
  - **Obsidian Black (#000000)**: The background.
  - **Glass White (#ffffff with opacity)**: The interface layer.
  
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: No hard borders, just layers of depth.
  - **Central Axis**: Content flows down a central "river" of lava/light.
  
  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass**: Backdrop filters on all containers.
  - **Heat Distortion**: Subtle shader effects on the background.
  
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid Response**: Elements ripple when touched.
  - **Parallax Depth**: Background moves slower than foreground.
  
  **Animation**:
  - **Flowing Gradients**: Background colors shift constantly.
  - **Dissolve**: Elements materialize from the fog.
  
  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *Montserrat* (Extra Bold).
  - **Body**: *Lato* (Light).
